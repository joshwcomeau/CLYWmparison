CLYWmparison
A weekend project by Joshua Comeau.
==============

As a hobbyist modern-day yoyoer, there are 3 primary stats I look at when purchasing a new yoyo:
- Diameter (in mm)
- Width (in mm)
- Weight (in g)

All of this information is available from the manufacturers, but there isn't any neat way to visualize that data. Until now.

Caribou Lodge Yoyo Works, CLYW for short, is a Canadian yoyo company that makes unbelievable high-end yoyos. I've decided to focus on their 25+ models for now, although this project could easily be expanded to include other manufacturers.
