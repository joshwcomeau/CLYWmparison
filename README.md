CLYWmparison
A weekend project by Joshua Comeau.
==============

Project Details:

As a hobbyist modern-day yoyoer, there are 3 primary stats I look at when purchasing a new yoyo:
- Diameter (in mm)
- Width (in mm)
- Weight (in g)

All of this information is available from the manufacturers, but there isn't any neat way to visualize that data. Until now.

Caribou Lodge Yoyo Works, CLYW for short, is a Canadian yoyo company that makes unbelievable high-end yoyos. I've decided to focus on their 25+ models for now, although this project could easily be expanded to include other manufacturers.


Technology Details:

I'm creating this project as an exercise in data visualization and testing. 
- For data visualization, I'll be using D3.js to create a radar chart.
- For testing, I'll be using Jasmine. I'm going to *attempt* to develop this using TDD (Test-Driven Development)

This is a purely front-end project, all done in JavaScript. In addition to D3 and Jasmine, I'll be using Underscore.js to aid with iteration, and I'll probably use Semantic UI for pretty and responsive CSS.
